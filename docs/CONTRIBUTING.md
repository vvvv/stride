## Check our issue tracker

Please take a look at our [issue tracker](https://github.com/stride3d/stride/issues), especially issues marked with [help wanted](https://github.com/stride3d/stride/labels/help%20wanted).

## Let other people know what you are doing

Once you work on some task, notify people on the appropriate issue (create one if none exists) to:
* make sure that no two people waste time doing the same thing
* lay out your plans and discuss it with collaborators to make sure it is properly architectured and would fit well in the project
* get feedbacks from other people

## Coding style

There's no Coding Style spec yet (and it will properly be done through a StyleCop & editorconfig file), but in the meantime please follow the coding style of other Stride files.
