MPLEX Summary
=============================================================================
Total number of states = 72, total accept states = 59, backup states = 6
Automaton will cater for left-anchored patterns
Original state number was 99, minimized machine has 72 states
Compression summary: used 292 nextstate entries, plus 126 map entries
- Uncompressed automaton would have 4 718 592 nextstate entries
- Input characters are packed into 35 equivalence classes
- CharClass compression 99,95%, 35 entries Vs 65 536
- Nextstate table compression 88,41%, 292 entries Vs 2 520
- CharacterMap compression is 99,81%, 126 entries Vs 65 536
- Decision tree depth is 1
